# What I learned making this game
  The main goal of this project was to learn more about using web sockets and building a web apps with React, using hooks.  

  I learned how to connect the client and server through a web socket and how to use this connection to communicate between clients. I also learned about the use of namespaces as they relate to sockets, and how to create, join, and communicate with rooms within each namespace. 
  
  This game has also allowed me to improve my working knowledge of hooks and the context API from React. All state management was done with hooks and the context API.
  
  This project was implemented using Socket.io and Express, as well as ReactJS for the front-end.
